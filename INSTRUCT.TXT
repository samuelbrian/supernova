                       ----------------------

Supernova is an adventure set in the future.  You begin on a remote
mining planet, with little to look forward to except another back-
breaking day in the mines.

To play Supernova, type sentences such as: OPEN THE HATCH THEN ENTER
THE SHIP, or SHOOT THE CREATURE WITH THE RAY GUN THEN GET EVERYTHING.
Supernova recognizes over 1000 words.

Read each room description carefully, examine anything that looks
important, and try to explore all possible passages and rooms.  Draw
a map on a piece of paper as you move through Supernova's "world."

1998 Update Notes:

1) This game is no longer registerable.  It has been released (in
   March of 1998) as freeware.

2) In Game screens still talk about registering, because we have no
   way of recompiling the game to remove them.

3) Older releases of this game stated that you can receive the source
   code for $100.  This offer is no longer valid.

4) Supernova is (c) 1986/1998 Apogee Software, Ltd.

ENTERING COMMANDS, PHRASES, FULL SENTENCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

All commands, etc. are entered at the blinking ">>".

A simple phrase might be DRINK, WALK EAST or EX CONTROLS.  Every phrase
may contain only one verb.

Multiple verb phrases and commands may be combined on a single input line
by separating with a period or the word THEN.  For example, EAST. NORTH.
OPEN HATCH THEN CLIMB DOWN LADDER.  The word IT refers to the last noun.

The game only understands the first seven letters of any word used.


SAVE AND RESTORE COMMANDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAVE and RESTORE are necessary because completing a game may require many
hours of play.

Before you finish a game session, type SAVE.  The game will clear the
screen and respond: "Which disk drive?" (default is A)  If you have a
two-drive system, insert a formatted disk in drive B and type B [enter].
With a single-drive system, remove the game disk and insert a formatted
disk, press [enter].  The game will respond: "SAVE under what file name?"
(Note: '/' aborts the SAVE.)  Type in a file name that the game can use to
save you current game location and status.  It is best to use a name that
refers to your current room, i.e. KITCHEN.  Also at this point you can
type DIR or FILES to get a current list of save names already in use on
that disk.

RESTORE your file in the same way, but with the RESTORE command
