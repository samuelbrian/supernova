# Supernova

```
      Working 14 hours a day in the core of some dusty, smelly mine
               is not your idea of the perfect lifestyle.
  Barre-An is a dust ball in space, its only salvation being that it is
  rich in precious barre-an metal.  Or used to be.  Nowadays the mines
     don't seem so generous, which is why you're looking for a more
                           profitable venture.
       A break, that's all you ask for, maybe today you figure...

This is a 2018 Free Pascal port of Scott Miller's **Supernova**,
originally released in 1987 for MS-DOS.
The original source code and binaries can be found on the

**Supernova** is best enjoyed on an 80x25 character terminal console.
